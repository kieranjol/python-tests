Usage
========================

Arrangement
-----------

sipcreator.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Accepts one or more files or directories as input and wraps them up
   in a directory structure in line with IFI procedures using
   ``copyit.py``.
-  Source objects will be stored in an /objects directory. Directory
   structure is: parent directory named with a UUID, with three child
   directories (objects, logs metadata):
-  Metadata is extracted for the AV material and MD5 checksums are
   stored for the entire package. A log records the major events in the
   process.
-  Usage for one directory -
   ``sipcreator.py -i /path/to/directory_name -o /path/to/output_folder``
-  Usage for more than one directory -
   ``sipcreator.py -i /path/to/directory_name1 /path/to/directory_name2 -o /path/to/output_folder``
-  Run ``sipcreator.py -h`` for all options.

accession.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Accessions a package that has been through the Object Entry
   procedure.
-  Currently this just works with packages that have been generated
   using ``sipcreator.py``. SHA512 manifests are created,the OE number
   is replaced by an accession number, and the sipcreator logfile is
   updated with the various events that have taken place.
-  Usage for one directory - ``accession.py /path/to/directory_name``
-  Run ``accession.py -h`` for all options.

batchaccession.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Batch process packages by running ``accession.py`` and
   ``makepbcore.py``
-  The script will only process files with ``sipcreator.py`` style
   packages. ``makeffv1.py`` and ``dvsip.py`` packages will be ignored.
-  Usage for processing all subdirectories -
   ``batchaccession.py /path/to/directory_name``
-  Run ``batchaccession.py -h`` for all options.

order.py
~~~~~~~~

-  Audits logfiles to determine the parent of a derivative package.
-  This script can aid in automating large accessioning procedures that
   involve the accessioning of derivatives along with masters, eg a
   Camera Card and a concatenated derivative, or a master file and a
   mezzanine.
-  Currently, this script will return a value :``None``, or the parent
   ``OE`` number. It also prints the OE number in its ``OE-XXXX`` just
   for fun.
-  Usage for one directory - ``order.py /path/to/directory_name``

makepbcore.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Describes AV objects using a combination of the PBCore 2 metadata
   standard and the IFI technical database.
-  This script takes a folder as input. Either a single file or multiple
   objects will be described.
-  This will produce a single PBCore CSV record per package, even if
   multiple objects are within a package. The use case here is complex
   packages such as XDCAM/DCP, where we want a single metadata record
   for a multi-file object.
-  The CSV headings are written in such a way to allow for direct import
   into our SQL database.
-  Usage for one directory - ``makepbcore.py /path/to/directory_name``
-  Run ``makepbcore.py -h`` for all options.

deletefiles.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Deletes files after ``sipcreator.py`` has been run, but before
   ``accession.py`` has been run.
-  Manifests are updated, metadata is deleted and the events are all
   logged in the logfile.
-  This script takes the parent OE folder as input. Use the ``-i``
   argument to supply the various files that should be deleted from the
   package.
-  Usage for deleting two example files -
   ``deletefiles.py /path/to/oe_folder -i path/to/file1.mov path/to/file2.mov``
-  Run ``deletefiles.py -h`` for all options.

rearrange.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Rearranges files into a subfolder files after ``sipcreator.py`` has
   been run, but before ``accession.py`` has been run.
-  Manifests are updated, files are moved, and the events are all logged
   in the logfile.
-  This is useful in conjunction with ``sipcreator.py`` and
   ``deletefiles.py``, in case a user wishes to impose a different
   ordering of the files within a large package. For example, from a
   folder with 1000 photographs, you may wish to create some sufolders
   to reflect different series/subseries within this collection. This
   script will track all these arrangement decisions.
-  This script takes the parent OE folder as input. Use the ``-i``
   argument to supply the various files that should be moved. The
   ``new_folder`` argument declares which folder the files should be
   moved into. Run ``validate.py`` to verify that all went well.
-  Usage for moving a single file into a subfolder -
   ``rearrange.py /path/to/oe_folder -i path/to/uuid/objects/file1.mov -new_folder path/to/uuid/objects/new_foldername``
-  Run ``rearrange.py -h`` for all options.

Transcodes
----------

makeffv1.py
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Transcodes to FFV1.mkv and performs framemd5 validation. Accepts
   single files or directories (all video files in a directory will be
   processed). CSV report is generated which gives details on
   losslessness and compression ratio.
-  Usage for single file - ``makeffv1.py filename.mov``
-  Usage for batch processing all videos in a directory -
   ``makeffv1.py directory_name``

bitc.py
~~~~~~~

-  Create timecoded/watermarked h264s for single files or a batch
   process.
-  Usage for single file - ``bitc.py filename.mov``
-  Usage for batch processing all videos in a directory -
   ``bitc.py directory_name``
-  This script has many extra options, such as deinterlacing, quality
   settings, rescaling. Use ``bitc.py -h`` to see all options

prores.py
~~~~~~~~~

-  Transcode to prores.mov for single/multiple files.
-  Usage for single file - ``prores.py filename.mov``
-  Usage for batch processing all videos in a directory -
   ``prores.py directory_name``
-  This script has many extra options, such as deinterlacing, quality
   settings, rescaling. Use ``prores.py -h`` to see all options

concat.py
~~~~~~~~~

-  Concatenate/join video files together using ffmpeg stream copy into a
   single Matroska container. Each source clip will have its own chapter
   marker. As the streams are copied, the speed is quite fast.
-  Usage:
   ``concat.py -i /path/to/filename1.mov /path/to/filename2.mov -o /path/to/destination_folder``
-  A lossless verification process will also run, which takes stream
   level checksums of all streams and compares the values. This is not
   very reliable at the moment.
-  Warning - video files must have the same technical attributes such as
   codec, width, height, fps. Some characters in filenames will cause
   the script to fail. Some of these include quotes. The script will ask
   the user if quotes should be renamed with underscores. Also, a
   temporary concatenation textfile will be stored in your temp folder.
   Currently only tested on Ubuntu.
-  Dependencies: mkvpropedit, ffmpeg. ## Digital Cinema Package Scripts
   ##

dcpaccess.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Create h264 (default) or prores transcodes (with optional subtitles)
   for unencrypted, single/multi reel Interop/SMPTE DCPs. The script
   will search for all DCPs in subdirectories, process them one at a
   time and export files to your Desktop.
-  Usage: ``dcpaccess.py dcp_directory``
-  Use ``-p`` for prores output, and use ``-hd`` to rescale to 1920:1080
   while maintaining the aspect ratio.
-  Dependencies: ffmpeg must be compiled with libopenjpeg -
   ``brew install ffmpeg --with-openjpeg``.
-  Python dependencies: lxml required.
-  Further options can be viewed with ``dcpaccess.py -h``

dcpfixity.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Verify internal hashes in a DCP and write report to CSV. Optional
   (experimental) bagging if hashes validate. The script will search for
   all DCPs in subdirectories, process them one at a time and generate a
   CSV report.
-  Usage: ``dcpfixity.py dcp_directory``
-  Further options can be viewed with ``dcpfixity.py -h``

dcpsubs2srt.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   destination and comparing the two. Skips hidden files and
   directories.
-  Usage: ``moveit.py source_dir destination_dir``
-  Dependencies: OSX requires gcp - ``brew install coreutils``

manifest.py
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Creates relative md5 or sha512 checksum manifest of a directory.
-  Usage: ``manifest.py directory`` or for sha512 hashes:
   ``manifest.py -sha512 directory``
-  By default, these hashes are stored in a desktop directory, but use
   the ``-s`` option in order to generate a sidcecar in the same
   directory as your source.
-  Run ``manifest.py -h`` to see all options.

makedfxml.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  WARNING - until this issue is resolved, this script can not work with
   Windows: https://github.com/simsong/dfxml/issues/29
-  Prints Digital Forensics XML to your terminal. Hashes are turned off
   for now as these will usually already exist in a manifest. The main
   purpose of this script is to preserve file system metadata such as
   date created/date modified/date accessed.
-  This is a launcher script for an edited version of
   'https://github.com/simsong/dfxml/blob/master/python/walk\_to\_dfxml.py'.
   The edited version of ``walk_to_dfxml.py`` and the ``Objects.py``
   library have been copied into this repository for the sake of
   convenience.
-  Usage: ``makedfxml.py directory``.
-  NOTE: This is currently a proof of concept. Further options, logging
   and integration into other scripts will be needed.
-  There may be a python3 related error on OSX if python is installed
   via homebrew. This can be fixed by typing ``unset PYTHONPATH`` in the
   terminal.

sha512deep.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Quick proof of concept sha512 checksum manifest generator as not many
   command line tools support sha512 right now. name is a play on the
   hashdeep toolset.
-  Usage: ``sha512deep.py directory``

validate.py
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Validate md5 or SHA512 sidecar manifests. Currently the script
   expects two spaces between the checksum and the filename.
-  In packages that have been generated with sipcreator.py, the results
   of the process will be added to the logfile and the checksum for the
   logfile will update within the md5 and sha512 manifests
-  Usage: ``validate.py /path/to/manifest.md5`` or
   ``validate.py /path/to/_manifest-sha512.txt``

batchfixity.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Batch MD5 checksum generator. Accepts a parent folder as input and

   container. PREMIS XML log files are generated with hardcoded IFI
   values for the source DPX sequence and the transcoded mezzanine file
   in the respective /metadata directory
-  A whole file MD5 manifest of everything in the SIP are also created.
   Work in progress - more testing to be done.

   workhorse.
-  A whole file MD5 manifest of everything in the SIP are also created.
   Work in progress - more testing to be done.
-  Usage - ``rawbatch.py directory``
-  rawbatch accepts multiple parent folders, so one can run
   ``rawbatch.py directory1 directory2 directory3`` etc

seq.py
~~~~~~

Specific Workflows
------------------

mezzaninecheck.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Checks folders in order to see if either 0 or >1 files exist in a
   mezzanine/objects folder.
-  
-  Usage: ``mezzaninecheck.py /path/to/parent_folder``

loopline.py
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Workflow specific to the Loopline project.
-  makeffv1.py and bitc.py are run on the input, unless a DV file is
   present, in which case bitc.py and dvsip.py will be run.
-  A proxies folder for the h264 files will be created within your
   parent folder if it does not already exist.
-  Usage: ``loopline.py /path/to/parent_folder`` or
   ``loopline.py /path/to/file``

masscopy.py
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Copies all directories in your input location using moveit.py ONLY if
   a manifest sidecar already exists.
-  This is useful if a lot of SIPs produced by makeffv1 are created and
   you want to move them all to another location while harnessing the
   pre-existing checksum manifest.
-  WARNING - It is essential to check the log file on the
   desktop/ifiscripts\_logs for each folder that transferred!!

   ``dvsip.py /path/to/file``

makefolders.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Creates a logs/objects/metadata folder structure with a UUID parent
   folder. This is specific to a film scanning workflow as there are
   seperate audio and image subfolders. You can specifiy the values on
   the command line or a terminal interview will appear which will
   prompt you for filmographic reference number, source accession number
   and title. Use ``makefolders.py -h`` for the full list of options.
-  Usage: ``makefolders.py -o /path/to/destination``

loopline\_repackage.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Retrospectively updates older FFV1/DV packages in order to meet our
   current packaging requirements. This should allow accession.py and
   makepbcore.py to run as expected. This will process a group of
   packages and each loop will result in the increment by one of the
   starting OE number. Use with caution.
-  This script should work on files created by
   ``makeffv1.py dvsip.py loopline.py``
-  Usage: ``loopline_repackage``
